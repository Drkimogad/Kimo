🚀 Installation & Usage
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kimo-ai.git
cd kimo-ai
2️⃣ Run Locally (No Server Needed!):

Simply open index.html in your browser.
The app works entirely offline once loaded!

3️⃣ Install as PWA (Optional):

Open the app in Chrome or Edge.
Click the "Install" button or go to browser settings → Install Kimo AI.

🛠️ How It Works
✅ AI Models load from the /models/ folder.
✅ Text Analysis and Image Classification are handled locally using TensorFlow.js.
✅ Service Worker (sw.js) caches essential files, allowing offline access.
✅ Handwriting Recognition is powered by Tesseract.js, processed offline for high accuracy.

🌍 Offline Support
If the app detects no internet connection, it loads offline.html.
Preloaded AI models continue working without needing the internet.
🔧 Adding New AI Models
To add a new model: 1️⃣ Place it in /models/.
2️⃣ Update models.js to load it.
3️⃣ Modify utils.js or script.js (if needed).
